# Flutter Bloc Pattern Example
Just a Simple Flutter App showcasing the Bloc Pattern and how it can be used to architect complex application state.

The idea is to do some basic CRUD on an API and use the [Flutter Bloc Library](https://felangel.github.io/bloc/) for state management

The following Articles provide some background to this idea:

  - [Part 1](https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/08/reactive-programming---streams---bloc/): Didier goes into explaining Streams and providing an intuition around them
  - [Part 2](https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/12/reactive-programming---streams---bloc---practical-use-cases/): The idea of EventState Blocs are introduced here, from which the Flutter Library is based on.  I recommend following Didier's Blogs for interesting insights of Dart Paradigms that can make for powerful apps.
